# 3D-printers
Marlin software mods/config for my 3D printers

I built the first from scratch out of wood way back before 3D kits were readily available.  In fact it was even more basic than the picture below as the original was used to print the plastic parts that are now used in the upgraded version.  I bought the AnetA8 kit because it was a pain changing between plastics all the time.  The kit was modified to include some extra support and add a servo driven bed leveling sensor switch.
